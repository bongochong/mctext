**MCText**

A clone of Guy Rutenberg's Markov Chain Text Generator using the Boost C++ library.

The [binary file](https://github.com/bongochong/mctext-0.2/raw/master/binary/mctext) is compiled against libboost 1.58, and depends on the libboost-program-options package. It is suitable for any LiGNUx environment with that package installed.

All I really did was a little cleanup and recompile it. It's nice though, and fun to play around with.
